# Machine-Learning-Methods

This is a series of lecture I taught students at ONE Innovation Hub, Offa as part of their curriculum of learning Machine Learning Methods,
it is important to know about the different machine learning algorithms as this impacts the decision on which algorithm to use for
which problem. In the repository, I have collated common ML algorithms used and I have explained with both a powerpoint slide
as well an ipynb notebook.

Machine Learning Algorithms discussed her include:

1. Support Vector Machine

2. Decision Tree

3. Naiye Bayes

4. Ensemble methods e.g. RandomForest, AdaBoost, XGBoost etc.

5. Clustering methods e.g. K-Means Clustering
